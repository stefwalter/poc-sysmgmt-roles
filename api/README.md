# Varlink System Service Configuration API

Instead of a group of individual human-centric, domain-specific configuration,
provide a view of the services with a simple remote-manageable, machine-readable,
strongly typed, declarative-only configuration format.

Varlink is a schema language that supports named structs, tagged unions,
custom defined types and all usual basic types of programming languages.
It describes our API.
